These files describe the derivation of skill levels from SOC2000.
"SOC is designed as a classification applicable to all paid jobs performed by economically active persons in the United Kingdom. Defined as a set of tasks or duties to be carried out by one person, the notion of a job represents a basic element in the employment relationship. Jobs are usually structured by employers (or by the worker in the case of self-employment) and others, including professional bodies, employer and/or worker organisations and governments, may regulate their definition. Jobs are recognised primarily by the associated job title. They are classified into groups according to the concept of ‘skill level’ and ‘skill specialisation’." (ONS 2000, p:4)
There are four skills levels: Low Lower Middle Upper Middle High
In SOC2000, and its predecessor SOC90, skill level is defined with respect to the duration of training and/or work experience recognised in the field of employment concerned as being normally required in order to perform the activities related to a job in a competent and efficient manner.
This derivation of skill levels for SOC2000 is based on the documentation provided by ONS (2000)
